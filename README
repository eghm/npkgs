I work on many machines running several unix-like operating systems,
and I want a consistent set of tools.  This project contains a set of
build scripts to build all my favorite unix tools (gnu ls, wget, curl,
screen, git, subversion, perl, apache, etc)., with all my favorite
options (e.g. 256 color terminal support) compiled so they work well
together (e.g. apache mod_svn and git-svn).

The goal of this project is to create a simple ports-tree like system
that works on any unix-like operating system.  At the moment I am
testing heavily on OS X, Open Solaris, and Solaris 10.

There are some amazing package management systems out there for a
number of operating systems.  I chose to do a number of things
different.

First, the assumption is that you are not building or installing these
packages as root.  Some of the prerequs may require root, but the
number of external dependencies is kept as low as possible.  This
minimized the amount of customization that has to be done on each
machine.

Second, you will choose a prefix where you want the packages installed
(your PREFIX).  You could choose /usr/local, or you could just as
easily choose /foo.  Once you make up your mind, you will need to add
/foo/bin and /foo/sbin to your PATH.

Third, every package is installed into it's own version-specific
directory.  That's right, nothing gets installed directly into
PREFIX/bin.  Instead foo-1.0 will be installed into
PREFIX/root/foo-1.0.  This makes it very natural to have multiple
versions of any package installed at the same time.  A symlink will be
created at PREFIX/root/foo to point to the one you want selected by
default.

  PREFIX/
         root/
              foo-1.0
              foo-1.2
              foo-2.0
              foo      => foo-1.2

Then, all files in the directory tree selected by the 'foo' symlink
will be overlayed back into PREFIX.  For example, the file:

  PREFIX/foo/bin/foo.pl

would get symlinked back to simply:

  PREFIX/bin/foo.pl

This allows you to simply have PREFIX/bin in your path without needing
to have the bin directory of every package you have installed.  Otoh,
it also gives you the flexibility to select a different version of a
package if you prefer.  For example, if you wanted to use the foo-2.0
version of foo.pl, you could simply set your path up like so:

  export PATH="$PREFIX/root/foo-2.0/bin:$PREFIX/bin:$PATH"

This works great for testing out new packages without having to remove
the old ones.  It also means that you can instantly look at any file
in $PREFIX and know exactly what package it came from (where does the
symlink point?).

This is especially good if you tend to do all your compiling on a
single machine and then replicate that directory out to your
production machines.  In such cases, you can can easily pick and
choose which packages to install on which machines by simply not
copying those package's directories.

INSTALLING

1. clone the git project

  cd /home/me
  git clone git://github.com/wu/wuports.git

2. set up some environment variables

  export NPKG_PREFIX="/usr/foo"
  export NPKG_PATH="/home/me/wuports"
  export PATH="/usr/foo/bin:/usr/foo/sbin:$PATH"

3. set up any custom config for your host or O/S (see the examples)

   $NPKG_PATH/common/os/MyOS/default.sh
   $NPKG_PATH/common/os/MyOS/version.sh
   $NPKG_PATH/common/host/shorthostname.sh

4. install c compiler(s) on your system

  - os x
    - install developer tools
    - install gcc

  - solaris 10
    - install the sun compiler
    - install gcc from sunfreeware.com - required for a few packages

  - opensolaris
    - pfexec pkg install SUNWgcc sunstudio
    - install the devel/cbe port
      - this should be done with your own account, not root
      - pfexec mkdir -p /opt/dtbld/packages
      - pfexec chown myuser /opt/dtbld/packages
      - cd devel/cbe; ./cbe-1.7.0-rc1.x86.sh

5. start installing

  cd $NPKG_PATH/devel/git
  ./git.sh

The package source will be downloaded and expanded into a work/
subdirectory.

If there are any prereqs for your package, they will be displayed.
Note that prereqs are not automatically followed, you'll have to set
into the prereq directory and build that package, then return to your
original build.  There is a plan to build a wrapper script in the
future to follow the dependency chain automatically.  If you don't
know what category the prereq falls into, you can easily find it by
using a glob in the category name.  For example, if you're installing
git and it requires tcl, from the git directory, use this:

  cd ../../*/tcl/

Hint: to keep track of a dependency chain, use 'pushd' to set into the
dependency's directory.  That way you can get back to the previous
package(s) you were building with 'popd'.  For example:

  # starting in the git directory
  ./git.sh
  # git build dies with tcl requirement, go to the tcl directory and build
  pushd ../../*/tcl
  ./tcl.sh
  # after tcl installs, return to the git build
  popd
  ./git.sh

6. uninstalling

Removing a package is a two-step process.  First, delete the
installed package(s) from $NPKG_PREFIX/root, e.g.:

  rm -rf $NPKG_PREFIX/root/git-1.6.5.3

Second, remove any symlinks that pointed to this package, i.e. the dead symlinks:

  find $NPKG_PREFIX -type l ! -xtype f ! -xtype d -ls -exec rm {} \;


SOLARIS AND OPENSOLARIS

You will need to adjust your library paths.  This can be done by
creating your own private ld.config file.  Run 'crle' without any
arguments to determine the current library paths, and then add
$NPKG_PREFIX.  There is no need to do this as root.

  export NPKG_PREFIX=/usr/local
  crle -c $NPKG_PREFIX/ld.config -l /lib:/usr/lib:$NPKG_PREFIX/lib -i /lib -i /usr/lib -i $NPKG_PREFIX/lib

The above provides the safest way to run npkg since it takes your
system library paths ahead of the npkg library paths.  Some ports
might not compile properly if you do this since the system libraries
might not be new enought to satisfy some of the npkg dependencies.
The recommended solution is therefore to list the npkg libraries
first:

  crle -c $NPKG_PREFIX/ld.config -l $NPKG_PREFIX/lib:/lib:/usr/lib -i $NPKG_PREFIX/lib -i /lib -i /usr/lib


After doing this you must export the LD_CONFIG environment variable to be
the path of the ld.config file you specified.

  export LD_CONFIG=$NPKG_PREFIX/ld.config

You'll need to repeat this process every time you install a new
dynamic library.  This will eventually be automated.
